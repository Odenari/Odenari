## ~Not~ Important

I know how to quit vim and how to center a div in a few different ways!
But how to enable bitbake lsp without autocommand? Or how to break free from imposter syndrome?!

One day I've bought Linux Book (900+ pages) and now I can't move my bearings.

Also I've installed Arch Linux manually to find out that there a zero-config, sane-default, free and open source, non-opianted, battery-included, feature-reach, user friendly - _Omarchy Linux_ :D

### In my spare time I:
- Enjoying mesmerizing nature
- [Listen to music](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=9bmpm_7iO2E&si=zzo1CxOuGqz9frIq)
- Thinking about why programmers created so much complexity and chaos
- Not learning Rust
- Adding YT videos to watch later playlist

### Have a nice day out there and stay hydrated
